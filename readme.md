Binford Logger
==============

A very simple default logger for the Binford SLF4J system.  It is loosely inspired by Log4J, but it is not intended to compete with log4js or other more mature libraries.

You typically would not use this library directly, but instead if you choose to use binford-slf4j then this library is the default logger.
